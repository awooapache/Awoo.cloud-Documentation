# Awoo.cloud-Documentation
This documentation is for setting up, configuring, and customizing a Pomf clone site. This documentation specifically relates to my https://awoo.cloud website but I am sure it can be of use to others. Source code for Pomf can be found here: https://github.com/pomf/pomf

### In this documentation I am specifically configuring the Pomf clone with:
  * Debian 9 Stretch
  * Apache2
  * MySQL
